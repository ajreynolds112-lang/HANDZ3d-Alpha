/**
 * Equipment Upgrade checks — run with `npx tsx script/equipmentCheck.ts`.
 *
 * The project has no test runner, so this is a self-contained assertion script
 * covering the gym crate's rules: unlock thresholds, the compounding price
 * curve, the flat diamond price, the every-tenth-level chest and its
 * tier, the per-level effect values, and how opponents inherit equipment
 * (sparring shares, the post-champion floor, weekly growth).
 *
 * Deliberately imports only `equipmentConfig`, which is engine-free — anything
 * pulling `engine.ts` drags the audio module's mp3 imports in and can't run
 * under tsx.
