/**
 * Purchase price checks — run with `npx tsx script/diamondLevelCostCheck.ts`.
 *
 * Both paid ladders — diamond level-ups and Force-bought stat points — price
 * off a counter in the save rather than off the fighter's level. The properties
 * worth guarding are the same for each: XP levels must not raise the price, the
 * counter must survive a save download/upload round trip, it must start over on
 * a new career, and a stale write must not be able to rewind it. The last
 * section covers the other end of the stat economy: what a point earned past
 * the cap pays instead.
