 *   small fighters and the pool comes down in a straight line.
 * - off: the number is a percent of the pool that fighter started the bout with.
 *   Everyone pays proportionally, which is how the round-end, knockdown and
 *   clean-punch-streak rules behaved before the toggle existed.
 *
 * The two unit sets are stored separately rather than converted, because there
 * is no honest exchange rate between them -- "3 points" is a different rule at
 * every pool size. Ticking one row's box swaps which set that row reads and
 * leaves both numbers untouched, so switching back and forth costs nothing.
 *
 * `enabled` is the on/off switch for each event, kept separate from its amount
