/**
 * Item effects — the gameplay layer behind the item catalog.
 *
 * `itemsConfig.ts` stores *what* an item is (rarity, limits, sell price); this
 * module stores *what it does* and resolves the active set into modifiers the
 * rest of the game queries:
 *
 *   getFightMods()      → engine.ts stat / stamina / stun / KD / rhythm hooks
 *   getTrainingMods()   → WL + Heavy Bag XP / SP hooks
 *   getSparringXpMult() → sparring EXP hook
 *   getGymIncomeMult()  → GymView passive income
 *   hasPerk()           → one-off unlocks (Credit Limit, Challenge Clause, ...)
 *   getActiveBoosts()   → the boost HUD icons + tooltips
 *
 * Durations
 *   permanent  — owned copies are always on (one-per-save keepsakes)
 *   instant    — consumed for a grant, never "active"
 *   nextFight / nextWL / nextHB / nextSpar — armed until that event resolves
 *   week       — armed for one roster week (tracked in `boostWeek`)
 *   camp       — armed for one fight camp (tracked in `boostCamp`)
 *   24h        — the single AC slot (tracked in `acBoost`)
