/**
 * Reward crates — the chests won from career fights.
 *
 * Each crate has a fixed rarity table (which tier each of its 2–5 items rolls
 * from) and a visual identity (body / trim colours + surface texture) used by
 * the crate reveal screen. How many crates a fight awards and the odds of each
 * one are configured per rank band in Neural Network → Roster Generation →
 * Rewards.
 *
 * Drawing an item is a two-step roll:
 *   1. pick a rarity tier from the crate's tier table
 *   2. pick an item of that tier weighted by its editor-set "Rarity %"
 * Items set to 0% Rarity, items that already sit at their lifetime obtainable
 * limit (9999 for consumables), keepsakes already received, and consumables
 * outside their rank-exclusive window are excluded from every draw.
